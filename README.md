# Tests-parser
This program was parsing tests and answers from the osvita.ua site
The program is really simple.
After I passed my National exams, I had to do a little android program which would have to help students prepare for their tests.
For that, I needed to have tests and answers to them. So I decided to parse it from osvita.ua. I was just parsing photos and answers. That's all.
